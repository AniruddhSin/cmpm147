				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I am trying to demonstrate a pseudo-random procedural generation of a manga panel using seeds while giving the image a "live" feel with a pulsating sun.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The given seed details how the horizon is drawn, but the clouds and the foreground mountains are always placed randomly, but have constraints on their shapes. The sun uses a sinusoisal ease to pulsate.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Using the professors example with Monument Valley really kickstarted my project, but I hit a road block on generating the clouds. It was difficult to make sure that I had a base cloud shape and then make sure there were enough clouds so that the bottom 2/3s of the screen had a blanket shape. I had a lot of fun with generating the mountains, but I had to keep them small and simple. The sun was rather easy once I looked at the examples from the slides. I think that this was a great learning opportunity for making custom shapes in javascript and learning how to use seeds and noise for procedural generation.</p>
